  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 tbsp oil of your choice</li>
    <li>1 medium onion (finely diced)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>3/4 tsp sea salt</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>2 tbsp fresh ginger (minced)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro (chopped)</li>
    <li>2-3 fresh green chiles (sliced with seeds)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp ground coriander</li>
    <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground tumeric</li>
    <li>1 28-oz can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 15-oz cans of chickpeas (slightly drained)</li>
    <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
    <li>2-3 tsp coconut sugar</li>
    <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, cumin, 
    and one-third of the salt (1/4 tsp as original recipe is written // 
    adjust if altering batch size).</li>
   <li>Add garlic, ginger, cilantro, and green chilies to a mortar and pestle 
    and grind into a rough paste (or use a small food processor to pulse into 
    a paste. Alternatively, just finely mince.) Then, add to the pan with the 
    onions.</li>
   <li>Next add ground coriander, chili powder, and turmeric and stir to coat. 
    Add a little more oil at this point if the pan is looking dry.</li>
   <li>Next add pureed tomatoes and chickpeas and remaining salt 
    (1/2 tsp as original recipe is written). If the mixture looks a little too 
    thick, add up to 1 cup (240 ml) water (I added ~1/2 cup (120 ml) // amount 
    as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). You’re 
    looking for a semi-thick soup consistency at this point, as it will cook down 
    into more of a stew.<li>
   <li>Increase heat to medium high until it reaches a rolling simmer, then reduce 
    heat to low or medium-low and maintain a simmer (uncovered) for 15-20 minutes, 
    or until thick and stew-like. Stir occasionally.</li>
   <li>In the meantime, if you don’t have garam masala seasoning, make your own by 
    adding (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) 
    2 small dried red chilies, 1 tsp black peppercorns (or 1/2 tsp ground black 
    pepper), 1 tsp cumin seeds (or 1/2 tsp ground cumin), 1 tsp cardamom pods 
    (or 1/2 tsp ground cardamom), 1/2 tsp cloves (or 1/4 tsp ground cloves), and 
    1/8 tsp nutmeg to a mortar and pestle or spice grinder and grind/mix into a 
    powder. Set aside.</li>
   <li>When the chana masala is thickened and bubbly, taste and adjust seasonings 
    as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, chili powder for heat, or a bit of 
    coconut sugar for sweetness and to offset the heat of the chilies.</li>
   <li>Remove from heat and add lemon juice and garam masala. Stir to mix, then 
    let cool slightly before serving. Fresh cilantro and lemon juice make an 
    excellent garnish. Chana masala can be enjoyed as a stew on its own, or it 
    can be delicious with white or brown rice (see my favorite method here), or 
    cauliflower rice. Lastly, my favorite is over roasted sweet potatoes and 
    broccoli (see notes for instructions).</li>
   <li>Leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days, or in the 
    freezer up to 1 month.</li>
