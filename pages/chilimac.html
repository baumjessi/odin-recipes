  <p>There’s nothing quite like a hot bowl of chili with all the fixings on a chilly night. This easy, one-pot 5-Bean Vegetarian Chili packs 
   all the flavor so you won’t even miss the meat!Like any good vegetarian chili, it’s packed with warm spices, a kick from some roasted 
   poblano peppers, and 5 of my favorite beans resulting in a super hearty and delicious chili recipe!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 yellow onion (diced)</li>
    <li>2 poblano peppers</li>
    <li>1 jalepeno pepper (minced)</li>
    <li>15 oz can fire-roasted diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire</li>
    <li>1 tbsp yellow mustard</li>
    <li>2 tbsp vinegar-based hot sauce</li>

    <li>15 oz can pinto beans</li>
    <li>15 oz can red kidney beans</li>
    <li>15 oz can great northern beans</li>
    <li>15 oz can navy beans</li>
    <li>2 cups vegetable broth</li>
    <li>1 can refried beans (optional)</li>
    <li>kosher salt</li>
    <li>freshly cracked black pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Chili Spice Mix</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 tbsp ancho chile powder</li>
    <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
    <li>1 tsp chipotle chile powder</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Roast the poblano pepper. Start by charring or broiling your poblano pepper 
     until blackened. Alternately, place it on a baking sheet and broil on high 
     heat, turning the pepper once, until blistered all over. Place the charred 
     pepper in a ziplock bag or a heat safe bowl and cover with plastic wrap. 
     Once the pepper is cool, peel and dice it.</li>
    <li>Drain and rinse the beans. Pour the canned beans into a colander or strainer 
     and rinse them well. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Mix the spices. Combine all the spices in a small bowl and whisk them together.</li>
    <li>Saute the veggies. Heat the olive oil in a dutch oven over medium heat. Once the 
     oil is hot, add the diced onion, poblano, and jalapeño. Let the veggies cook, 
     stirring occasionally, until they're soft–about 3-4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the spices. Add the spice blend in and stir often, until the spices are fragrant, 
     about 2-3 minutes. Add the tomatoes, Worcestershire, mustard, and hot sauce and stir 
     well. Use a rubber spatula to scrape up any browned bits that may have stuck to the 
     bottom of the pot.</li>
    <li>Add the beans and simmer. Add the drained and rinsed beans to the pot along with the 
     broth or water and stir well. Season with salt and pepper. Turn the heat down to low, 
     cover, and simmer for 1 hour. Stir every so often to make sure the chili isn't sticking 
     to the pot.</li>
    <li>Add the refried beans. This is an optional step, but if you like a thicker chili, add the
     refried beans and stir well. Let the chili simmer uncovered for another 10 minutes and then 
     season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Serve. Ladle the chili into bowls and top as desired.</li>
  </ol>
